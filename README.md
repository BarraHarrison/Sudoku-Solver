# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku puzzle is generated and then solved using Python script.
The generated puzzle and the solved sudoku puzzle are shown one after the other.

# How It Works
- A valid, fully-completed sudoku grid is created using backtracking
- Numbers are shuffled to ensure randomness
- Numbers are randomly removed from the grid to create blanks (represented as 0)
